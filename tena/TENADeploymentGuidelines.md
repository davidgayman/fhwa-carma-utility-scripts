| **Download the right TENA installation package versions** | Be careful to package and redistribute only runtime versions of TENA middleware components, not the development versions. This is stated in the license agreement.                                           |
| **Specify the right TENA installation package versions**  | In any insructions, build scripts, container specifications, dependencies, etc. utilized in a system, it is important to ensure the referenced TENA installation packages are "run-time" not "development".  |
| **No mirroring**                                          | Packaging for distribution is ok, mirroring is not.                                                                                                                                                          |
