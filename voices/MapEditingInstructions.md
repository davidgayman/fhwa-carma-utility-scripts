# Map Editing Instructions

## Getting map locations

1. Start CARLA
2. Start a manual car: scripts/run_scripts/.../manual_car.py
3. Drive the car around and observe the location coordinates displayed in the side panel overlay.
4. Run the draw_map_segments.py script to draw lines indicating locations, and convert to lat/lon.
